# Some Suggestions


## Magnification and Accessibility Tools

Apart from [the earlier suggestions](05_how_can_i_help.html#make-the-text-bigger), there are apps like [ZoomText](https://support.freedomscientific.com/Downloads/ZoomText) and [VoiceOver](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-voiceover-in-apps-iphe4ee74be8/ios) on iOS that improve visual and audio accessibility.  The Android equivalent seems to be called [TalkBack](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6006564?hl=en#use_screen_reader).


## Different Launchers

For the visually impared, increasing the size of the icons on a phone's home screen can be done using [BIG Launcher](http://biglauncher.com/) on Android. Still looking for a good suggestion for iOS.

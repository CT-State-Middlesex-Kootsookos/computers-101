    "# How can I help?\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is more about how to help people with computers than about computers themselves. It collates some information that I've gleaned from helping people who are less familiar with technology at hand than I am.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Take time to understand\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important thing to remember is that the person you are helping deserves respect, but is probably frustrated by their inability to do something with the technology. Spend time understanding what they are trying to do and what they have done to try to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the person has tried the right steps to achieve what they want, but perhaps in the wrong order. Or perhaps they've left out a crucial step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Take time to understand the problem and the person you're talking to.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Apply all updates\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers and other devices get many, many updates.  Sometimes, when an update is pending on a computer or device, the device stops working correctly.  This may not be obvious, so know how to find where updates are applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For Microsoft Windows, see {cite:ts}`windows_updates`.\n",
    "* For Apple MacOS, see {cite:ts}`macos_updates`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Apply all updates.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Have you tried...\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a well-known joke in IT circles that comes from the show [*The IT Crowd*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IT_Crowd).  The joke is that the first thing the IT help desk asks you is: \n",
    "\n",
    "*Have you tried turning it off and back on again?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this joke is funny because it's often true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turn off the computer. Perhaps even unplug it if that's easy to do. Wait for at least 30 seconds.  Check that all lights and LEDs are out. Plug the computer back in and turn it on again.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Restart the computer.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Check the cables\n",
    "\n",
    "Power cables, peripheral cables, mouse cables, USB cables, and other cables may seem like something that should **just work** but they often break or stop working as they should.\n",
    "\n",
    "If possible, change the cable for a different one of the same sort, and see if that fixes the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Change the cables.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Check the paper\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes printers stop working because they can't detect the paper is available, even when there are several sheets still in the feeder.  Add more sheets to the feeder, preferably filling it up to capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fill the printer with paper.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Check the ink\n",
    "\n",
    "Printers also sometimes stop working when only one of the ink cartridges is empty. Check the status of the printer, and look specifically at the ink levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fill the ink.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Check the settings\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many, many things that can go wrong with settings. Here is a list of things to check.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is the device on the Wi-Fi network?\n",
    "* Is the device on the **right** Wi-Fi network?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Driving a computer\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some tips for driving a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Make the text BIGGER\n",
    "\n",
    "Some websites have text that is very small. Most browsers have a way to increase the zoom level.\n",
    "\n",
    "* On Windows, pressing the control key and rotating the mouse wheel will zoom in and out.\n",
    "* On Windows, pressing the Windows button and the + symbol will zoom in (make text bigger). Pressing the Windows button and the - symbol will zoom out (make text smaller).\n",
    "* On MacOS, pressing the Command key and the + symbol will zoom in (make text bigger). Pressing the Command key and the - symbol will zoom out (make text smaller).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why can't I hear anything?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, check that the audio on the computer is not muted. Muting turns the volume all the way off, regardless of the volume setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "* On Windows, this can be done by checking the speaker symbol in the task bar in the bottom right of the screen.  \n",
    "* On MacOS, go to the Apple menu, open System Settings, and click Sound in the left hand list. Scroll down to the bottom and see that the checkbox beside the word **Mute** is not checked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, check that the audio on the computer is at an acceptable level.\n",
    "\n",
    "* On Windows, this can be done by clicking on the speaker symbol in the task bar in the bottom right of the screen, and checking the volume bar that appears.  \n",
    "* On MacOS, go to the Apple menu, open System Settings, and click Sound in the left hand list. Scroll down to the bottom and see the **Output volume** is at an appropriate level.  The sound volume can also be checked in the top bar by clicking the headphones or speaker icon and checking that the revealed volume control is all the way to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, check which applications are using the audio.  Sometimes, one application takes over complete control and won't let other applications make a sound.  The best thing is to close all applications that could possibly use the sound (including the one you want), and then open the one that you want."

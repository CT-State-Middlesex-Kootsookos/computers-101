# What is a computer?

A computer is any electronic device that stores and processes information: a desktop, a laptop, a cell phone, or a tablet. Some computers are "embedded" like Alexa or Google Home. Embedded computers are part of the "internet of things" (IOT).

A computer consists of:

- A **screen** or display to allow text, images, and colors to be shown,

```{index} screen

```

```{image} ./images/screen.jpg
:alt: display
:width: 300px
:align: center
```

- A **keyboard** to allow text to be entered,

```{index} keyboard

```

```{image} ./images/keyboard.jpg
:alt: keyboard
:width: 300px
:align: center
```

- A **mouse** or other pointing device to allow selection of things on the screen,

```{index} mouse

```

```{image} ./images/mouse.jpg
:alt: mouse
:width: 300px
:align: center
```

- A **case** to hold it all together, and

```{index} case

```

- Other **[peripherals](glossary.html#term-peripheral)** like USB ports, ethernet, microphone.
